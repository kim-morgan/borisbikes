As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

Dir["./lib/*.rb"].each { |file| require file }
station = DockingStation.new
20.times { station.dock Bike.new }
